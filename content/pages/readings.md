Brealey, Richard, Stewart Myers, and Franklin Allen. _Principles of Corporate Finance_. 9th ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2007. ISBN: 9780071266758.

Additional Readings
-------------------

These readings are not required, but are of interest to those wishing to delve further into the subject of finance.

Malkiel, Burton. _A Random Walk Down Wall Street_. New York, NY: W. W. Norton, 2007. ISBN: 9780393330335.

This best-selling introduction to investing is now in its 9th edition and as popular as ever because of its entertaining style and sage advice. This is a great way to ease into financial markets, particularly for those who are not financially inclined.

Bernstein, Peter. _Capital Ideas: the Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street_. New York, NY: Free Press, 1993. ISBN: 9780029030127.

Bernstein is one of the most well-respected and influential practitioners in the financial industry, and the founding editor of the _Journal of Portfolio Management_. This is a lively and beautifully written account of the most important ideas in academic finance, many of which were developed at MIT in the 1960's and 1970's.

Bodie, Zvi, Alex Kane, and Alan Marcus. _Investments_. 8th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2008. ISBN: 9780073382371.

Bodie, Kane, and Marcus focus exclusively on capital markets. They provide a more rigorous and thorough analysis of investments than Brealey, Myers, and Allen.

[_The Wall Street Journal_](http://online.wsj.com/home-page)

Often called the diary of financial markets, the Journal is still the leading business publication in the world and familiarity with its various columns, sections, and op-ed pieces is a must for any serious finance professional.
